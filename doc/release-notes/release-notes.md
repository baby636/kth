# version 0.1.0

- Conan infrastructure + Bintray repositories for easier installation (Linux, OSX, and Windows)
- New project: *bitprim-node-cint*. Implements a C interface for the node. In this version, the following functions are exposed:
    - fetch_last_height
    - fetch_block_height
    - fetch_block_header_by_hash
    - fetch_block_by_height
    - fetch_block_by_hash
    - fetch_merkle_block_by_height
    - fetch_merkle_block_by_hash
    - fetch_transaction
    - fetch_transaction_position
    - fetch_spend
    - fetch_history
    - validate_transaction
    - fetch_stealth
- Aside from the chain functions above, functions are available for operating with all their related data structures:
    - block_indexes
    - block
    - header
    - history
    - input
    - merkle_block
    - output
    - payment_address
    - point
    - script
    - transaction

All *fetch* functions are asynchronous, i.e. they return immediately and require a callback parameter to return the result. Also, each of these functions have a *get* sister function, which works synchronously, i.e. blocks until result is retrieved and returned directly.
